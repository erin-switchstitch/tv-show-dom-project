--------------------------------------------  Notes  ------------------------------------------------- 

TV Show Banner :

It'd be cool to have an image banner here for the image of the TV show. Have it as a fixed element which 
reduces opacity as the screen is scrolled down, until eventually it completely fades to nothing. I could
look into using some cool javascript creative coding here for the transition effect 


---------------


PopUp Button :

For the button / popup, after clicking it should then show the name of the website this episode data was 
pulled from as well as a link to the website. Use this guide https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_popup


---------------


Image Hover :

When the user hovers over the image, I want to apply an effect to the image (probably easiest to just place
another div/box ontop of it with opacity set to high) - and then display info such as the airdate, runtime and 
airtime. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp
